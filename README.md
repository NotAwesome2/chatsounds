# Chatsounds

Audio repo for [the chatsounds plugin](https://github.com/SpiralP/rust-classicube-chatsounds-plugin) for [ClassiCube](https://www.classicube.net/)~

## Adding sounds

Drag and drop sound files into [a folder](/sounds) to add them into the game easily!

It's better to categorize the sounds into folders. You can create a new folder by opening and editing [this url](/../../upload/master/sounds/folder_name).

Please make sure the files are [small and in a commonly used audio format](https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds/blob/master/HOW%20TO%20ADD%20SOUNDS.txt#L13) before uploading.

You can use the [Chatsounds Converter](https://chatsounds-converter.spiralp.xyz) to convert into small ogg files easily.

If you do not have access to this repo, you will have to click Fork at the top-right and use your own personal repo to make a pull request.
